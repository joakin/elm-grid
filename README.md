# joakin/elm-grid

Functions to operate on a set of coordinates and do something with them.

You can think of them as kind of like list comprehension helpers for 2d and 3d
lists.

Very useful where you would write nested for loops in imperative languages. For
example, when using `elm-graphics` or `elm-canvas` to do some sort of grid
drawings.

For 1 dimensional comprehensions use `List.range`.
